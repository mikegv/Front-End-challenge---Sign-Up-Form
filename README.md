# My Process
- I built this using create react app.  It is fully front end using react/javascript to validate the input values of the form.

- This was good practice for me for learning the process of vaidating forms without relying on any extra validation libraries. I also learned how different ways to alert a user about faulty input.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
